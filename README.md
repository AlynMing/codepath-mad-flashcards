# Flashcards

## Lab 4

#### App Description
I finally had a fully functional app by the end of Lab 3, but there's one more thing I want to do: make it delightful to use. As I already heard in the lecture and presentations, I can make your app really enjoyable to use by making it very responsive and playful. I did that with my Flashcards app by adding images and animations.

#### Required
- [x] User should see the app icon 
- [x] User should see a splash screen
- [x] User should see an flip animation when revealing the answer
- [x] User should see a slide animation when going to the next flashcard
- [x] User should see a slide animation when going to the previous flashcard
- [x] Push code to GitHub
#### Optional
- [ ] User should see a nicer flaschard with rounded corners, shadows, and animating when showing the first time
- [ ] User should see all views properly layout when using the app on a phone of different sizes
- [ ] Correct answer in multiple choice should be random

## Lab 3

#### App Description
In this lab I made my app finally a fully functional app that you can actually use to study and ship on the App Store. I allow users to create as many flashcards as they want, browse through them and persist them even if they close the app. While building this I learned how to store data and how to write more complex logic.

#### Required
- [x] User can browse through multiple flashcards
- [x] User can re-open the app and see previously created flashcards
- [x] Push code to GitHub
#### Optional
- [ ] User can delete a flashcard
- [ ] User can edit existing flashcard
- [ ] User can store multiple choice questions
