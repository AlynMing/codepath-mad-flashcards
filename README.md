# Flashcards

## Lab 2

#### App Description
In this lab, I continued to make my flashcards app better, adding new features on top of everything I did in the previous lab. I created a new screen where you're able to create new flashcards right from the app. That way whenever you want to study something new you can just create a new flashcard.

While building this, I learned how to create completely new screens, how to present them from my main screen, and how to pass data from one screen to another.

#### App Description
In this lab, I built the first version of my Flashcards app that I can later use to study. While building this app I learned how to place views on the screen, control them with code and make them change when you tap on them.
