# Flashcards

## Lab 3

#### App Description
In this lab I made my app finally a fully functional app that you can actually use to study and ship on the App Store. I allow users to create as many flashcards as they want, browse through them and persist them even if they close the app. While building this I learned how to store data and how to write more complex logic.

#### Required
- [x] User can browse through multiple flashcards
- [x] User can re-open the app and see previously created flashcards
- [x] Push code to GitHub
#### Optional
- [ ] User can delete a flashcard
- [ ] User can edit existing flashcard
